### Project Specification: "Internal Genius" - A Knowledge Base Chatbot

This document outlines the technical specifications for building the "Internal Genius," a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer employee questions using a company's internal documents.

---

### 1. Project Overview

The "Internal Genius" is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload a collection of documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT) and then query them in natural language. The system retrieves relevant information and generates an accurate, context-aware response, citing its sources. This project demonstrates expertise in RAG, a critical skill for modern AI development.

### 2. Core Components and Architecture

The application is built on a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and a powerful backend.

#### 2.1 Backend: The RAG Pipeline
The backend is responsible for all data processing and AI logic. The pipeline consists of two main stages: **Ingestion** and **Query/Generation**.

* **Ingestion Pipeline:**
    * **Document Loading:** Utilizes the **Docling** library for robust ingestion of various document types (PDFs, DOCX, etc.), preserving document structure and metadata.
    * **Chunking:** Employs **Docling's hybrid chunking** strategy, which intelligently splits documents into semantically coherent chunks while respecting the original document's structure (paragraphs, headings).
    * **Embedding:** Uses Google's **`gemini-embedding-001`** model to convert text chunks into high-quality numerical vectors. This model is chosen for its performance, cost-effectiveness on the free tier, and seamless integration with the Google ecosystem.
    * **Vector Database:** **ChromaDB** is used to store the generated embeddings and their corresponding text chunks. It is a lightweight, easy-to-use vector store perfect for a self-contained portfolio project.
* **Query/Generation Pipeline:**
    * **Query Embedding:** The user's natural language query is converted into a vector using the same **`gemini-embedding-001`** model.
    * **Retrieval:** The query vector is used to perform a similarity search in the ChromaDB, retrieving the top `k` most relevant document chunks.
    * **Generation:** The retrieved chunks are combined with the user's query and a system prompt. This augmented prompt is then sent to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** large language model (LLM) to generate a grounded response.
    * **Source Citation:** The final generated answer includes citations linking to the specific documents and chunks from which the information was sourced.
    * **Orchestration:** **LangGraph** is used to orchestrate the entire RAG pipeline, allowing for a stateful, multi-step workflow.

#### 2.2 Frontend: The User Interface
The frontend provides a clean and intuitive interface for user interaction.

* **Framework:** **React** is the chosen framework for building the single-page application.
* **API Communication:** The frontend communicates with the backend via a RESTful API built with **FastAPI**. This includes endpoints for document uploads and chat queries.

### 3. Tech Stack

* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
* **LLM:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **Embedding Model:** Google `gemini-embedding-001`
* **RAG Framework:** LangGraph (built on LangChain)
* **Document Processing:** Docling
* **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **API:** RESTful API

### 4. Advanced Components and Future Enhancements

To demonstrate a professional-grade solution, the project incorporates or allows for the addition of the following advanced components:

* **Evaluation System:** **LangSmith** is implemented for end-to-end tracing and systematic evaluation of the RAG pipeline. Metrics to be tracked include **Context Precision**, **Context Recall**, **Faithfulness** (for hallucination detection), and **Answer Relevance**. This demonstrates a data-driven approach to continuous improvement.
* **Query Transformation:** The system can be extended to perform query re-writing or breakdown of complex queries before retrieval to improve search results.
* **Re-ranking:** After the initial retrieval, a re-ranking model can be added to re-order the retrieved chunks, ensuring the most relevant information is presented to the LLM first.
* **Performance Optimization:** Asynchronous processing for document ingestion and caching for frequent queries can be implemented to improve scalability and reduce latency.

### 5. Deliverables

* **Fully Functional Web Application:** A deployed web application that demonstrates the end-to-end RAG pipeline.
* **Source Code:** A well-documented GitHub repository with the complete source code for both the backend and frontend.
* **Documentation:** A detailed `README.md` explaining the project architecture, tech stack, and setup instructions.
* **Technical Article:** A short article on a platform like Medium or LinkedIn that explains the RAG concept and the technical decisions made during the project. This serves to market the project and position the creator as a subject matter expert.

# Task 3.4: Performance Optimization

**Objective:** Implement asynchronous processing and caching.

**Steps:**

1.  Implement asynchronous processing for the document ingestion pipeline.
2.  Use a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to cache frequent queries and their responses.
3.  Benchmark the application's performance before and after the optimizations.

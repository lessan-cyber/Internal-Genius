# Task 1.3.5: Orchestration

**Objective:** Use LangGraph to manage the RAG workflow.

**Steps:**

1.  Add `langgraph` to the `backend/pyproject.toml` dependencies.
2.  Create a `rag_service.py` module in the `backend/services` directory.
3.  Define a stateful graph within the `RAGService` that represents the RAG pipeline.
4.  The graph should manage the flow of data between the different services (`DocumentService`, `EmbeddingService`, `GenerationService`) and the `VectorStoreRepository`.
